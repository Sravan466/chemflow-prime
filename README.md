## Quick Start

### 1. Clone and Install

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd chemical-reporting-system
npm install
```

### 2. Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://hdsldiyhhqwcsacdjdjv.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key_here
```

Get your Supabase keys from: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/hdsldiyhhqwcsacdjdjv/settings/api

### 3. Database Setup

1. Go to your Supabase dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/hdsldiyhhqwcsacdjdjv
